## How I Did It 

I started by looking at the code and how the project was started. I first fixed a small bug where an intern forgot to add the key prop in the map of tasks ( ðŸ¤« ). Then i implemented the different features starting with deleting a task, then editing a task, and making sure the small "Save" button only appears when the content is different. To do this, I initialized a state to capture all modified tasks, and then compared the modified task with the original task to check if I could make changes. I also took the time to update the API to add extra security to prevent anyone from bypassing the client. Finally, I decided to create a TaskCard component to organize my app better and make it look cleaner.
